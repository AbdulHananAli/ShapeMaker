 # ShapeMaker
Practice for for drag and drop event handlers.
This repository uses javaFX and standard java classes.
the GUI.java contains the interface and uses the shape_maker.java as an object.

The end result is an interface with a button.
By clicking the button a circle with a random colour is created on the interface.
The shape then can be moved by drag and drop.
